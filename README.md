## About

J.A.T.E is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) designed to run in your browser, even when offline, and it can also be installed on your local machine. This application employs various data persistence techniques to ensure its functionality, regardless of the browser's supported features. J.A.T.E utilizes an IndexedDB database with the idb package. For production access, the application is deployed on Heroku; you can find more details in the documentation.
